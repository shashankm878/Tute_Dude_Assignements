Assignment 1:
Task 1 gives solution for Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
    o	Addition
    o	Subtraction
    o	Multiplication
    o	Division

Wherein its explain how two variables taken from user, gone thru with all the mathematical operations which is defined in the problem statement

Task 2 gives solution for Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
  1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
  2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
  3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

Wherein its potrays, the input taken from user gets concatenates with a space in the full_name variable and print statement prints the greeting with calling the full_name variable.

Assignment 2:
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Description:
This Python program:
    Takes an integer input from the user.
    Checks whether the number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
    Prints the result accordingly.
Logic: 
    Uses % 2 to check remainder.
    If the remainder is not 0 → Odd.
    If the remainder is 0 → Even.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
Description:
This Python program:
    Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
    Calculates the total sum of these numbers.
    Prints the final sum.
Logic:
    Initialises sum to 0.
    Loops from 0 to 50 (inclusive).
    Adds each value to the sum.
