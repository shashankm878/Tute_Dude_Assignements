# Tute_Dude_Assignements
## Assignment 1:
Task 1 gives solution for Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
    o	Addition
    o	Subtraction
    o	Multiplication
    o	Division

Wherein its explain how two variables taken from user, gone thru with all the mathematical operations which is defined in the problem statement

Task 2 gives solution for Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
  1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
  2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
  3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

Wherein its potrays, the input taken from user gets concatenates with a space in the full_name variable and print statement prints the greeting with calling the full_name variable.

## Assignment 2:

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Description:

This Python program:
  1.  Takes an integer input from the user.
  2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
  3. Prints the result accordingly.

Logic: 
  1.  Uses % 2 to check remainder.
  2.  If the remainder is not 0 → Odd.
  3.  If the remainder is 0 → Even.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
Description:

This Python program:
  1.  Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
  2.  Calculates the total sum of these numbers.
  3.  Prints the final sum.



# Assignment 3 Programs

This repository contains two Python programs for Assignment 3:

- [`Assignment 3 Task 1.py`](./Assignment%203%20Task%201.py)
- [`Assignment 3 Task 2.py`](./Assignment%203%20Task%202.py)

Below is an explanation of the functionality of each program.

## Assignment 3 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Description:**  
This program calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using a recursive function.

**Functionality:**  
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Defines a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial recursively:
  - If `n < 2`, returns 1 (base case).
  - Otherwise, returns `n * factorial(n-1)`.
- Calls the `factorial` function with the user's input and prints the result.

**Sample Usage:**
```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Assignment 3 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Description:**  
This program demonstrates the use of Python's `math` module to perform common mathematical calculations.

**Functionality:**  
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Calculates and displays:
  - The square root of the number (`sqrt`)
  - The natural logarithm (base e) of the number (`log`)
  - The sine of the number (in radians) (`sin`)

**Sample Usage:**
```
Enter a number: 4
Square root  =  2.0
Logarithm = 1.3862943611198906
Sine = -0.7568024953079282
```

# Assignment 5

This directory contains solutions to two Python programming tasks for Assignment 5:

- **Assignment 5 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks**
- **Assignment 5 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing**

---

## Assignment 5 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

**Functionality:**
- The program defines a dictionary named `student_marks` where student names are keys and their marks are values.
- It prompts the user to enter a student's name.
- If the entered name exists in the dictionary, the program displays the student's marks.
- If the name does not exist, it displays a message: "Student not found."

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter the student's name: Bob
Bob's marks: 92
```
```
Enter the student's name: John
Student not found.
```

---

## Assignment 5 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

**Functionality:**
- The program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- It extracts the first five elements of the list using slicing (`numbers[:5]`).
- It reverses these extracted elements (`first_five[::-1]`).
- It prints:
  - The original list,
  - The extracted sub-list,
  - The reversed sub-list.

**Sample Output:**
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
